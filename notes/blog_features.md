Please let me know if there are specific features you'd like more details on or if there's a particular aspect of the blog app you'd like assistance with.



the features i expect are
blogging
commenting
liking
favourite
share of blog, this one should just copy the blog link to their clipboard
CKEditor for admin to use and upload blogs
group/community chat (this will allow admin create groups on specific topics and the users can chat each other in the groups) and they should be able to upload images, send messages and other files, even they should be able to send emojis, if there is any emoji library add it

i'll like comments, likes, favourite and share to be utils in the blog app
